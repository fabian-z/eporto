`eporto` is a simple web application allowing you to buy and print digital stamps from Deutsche Post.

## Usage

Check out the `docs` folder in this repository for details on how to request API credentials. The application will not work you don't have your own API access.
Configuration is expected in a file `eporto.conf`, see the example file.

This software is currently optimized for use on Linux and uses the `lpr` command with a configured printer name to print stamps after buying.
PRs for cross-platform compatibility welcome.
